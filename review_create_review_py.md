# Documentation for create_review.py

## Code Review

Your code seems straightforward and with minimal flaws. Aside from some redundancy when handling exceptions which will not interfere with the scalability or functionality of your program, a point worth noting is in this section:

```
def get_code_review(file_content):
    client = OpenAI(api_key=openai_api_key)
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4", ...
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

There's no gpt-4 model in the OpenAI library, adjust to correct model 'gpt-3' so it should be corrected as shown below:

```Python
def get_code_review(file_content):
    client = OpenAI(api_key=openai_api_key)
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3", ...
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

Marvelous work with in-depth handling different cases of file and context-based discrepancies. I do commend your efforts in this and encourage you maintain this robust thought of approach in consistency with clean functionality when writing future pieces of codes of this standard. Keep up the good work!
