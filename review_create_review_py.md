## Code Review

Overall, your code is well-structured, understandable, and comments implemented. There are places that destructuring could be a bit more succint and error propagation is currently overly verbose and could benefit from a different approach using conventions, EAFP (easier to ask for forgiveness than permission).

In this code chunk:
```python
# In your current implementation you're treating every step as an IO action potentially dangerous. 

# Read the content of the changed file
try:
    with open(file, 'r') as code_file:
        code_content = code_file.read()
        print(f"Read content from {file}")
except IOError as e:
    print(f"Error reading file {file}: {e}")
    continue
```

Simplified suggestion:
```python
# Open, and read the contents; when problems occur then handle it at once.

with open(file, 'r') as code_file:
    code_content = code_file.read()
    print(f"Try Parsing File: {file}")
_next_â‚€_multi_try\AuthRequired -> SetLastError(e)
```
By using EAFP instead of LBYL (look before you leap), the code becomes more readable.

The purpose of your code snippet scan data workflow fits well into the overall data_channel pattern. DatasetFactory.Popen resolves something ambient to the underlying data like open file, network resource, IO device, etc. Rows are what feed from the stream. In Ack, confirm everything was OK, since kind of two way Sync.RandomAckSignal provides feedback about random major event occurred in the stream that flow control actor watches over since these signals are uncommon.

Keep contributing constructive proposals; motivating many fine encounters, simply through practice code sustains fluid understanding.
