## Code Review

I've scanned through your code and it seems quite comprehensive, but there's one small area where you've put a TODO. It relates to the part of your code where the bot interacts with the OpenAI API to generate automated code reviews. 

```python
client = OpenAI(api_key=openai_api_key)
```

Here you initialize the OpenAI client each time when processing a new individual file that needs an automated code review. If a commit contains numerous files, this operation could theoretically become repetitively costly.

Let me suggest an improvement for this scenario:

```python
# Initialize the OpenAI client outside of the loop to avoid multiple initializations:
client = OpenAI(api_key=openai_api_key)

def get_code_review(file_content):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        ...
    '')
```

In this manner, you initialize the OpenAPI client once and it gets reused in every file iteration. Efficient and less-memory hogging. Stick  to the basics of sound programming: do not repeatedly instantiate if it's not a necessity. Keep your scripts running healthy!

Apart from this small tweak, nice job getting your OpenAI code review bot up and running!

All the luck, my friend - well done! ðŸŽ‰
